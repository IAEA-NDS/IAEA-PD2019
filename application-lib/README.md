# Application files (ACE)

The ace files in the subdirectories
have been produced by ACEMAKER.
More information about the processing is
available in [this report][iaeapd19ace].
The files in the subdirectory `ace`
can be used as cross section files
for MCNP whereas the processed files
in `extace` contain additional data,
see the [README][extace-readme] there.
